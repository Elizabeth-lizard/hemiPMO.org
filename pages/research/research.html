                If you believe that you have hemi-PMO or have other types of recognition impairments and are interested in becoming involved with research, please <a href="{{ "contact/" | relative_url }}">contact us</a> using our form. We will try to get you involved with studies we are conducting or we can try to put you in contact with researchers in your area. We carry out studies over the internet so distance is not an impediment to participating in many of our behavioral studies.
            </p>

                In addition to providing important data for research on hemi-PMO, people with this condition often find that they gain greater insight into their condition from testing. For example, we assess abilities with a variety of object categories (horses, flowers, cars, etc.) and test other types of face processing (e.g., emotional expression recognition; sex, age, and attractiveness via the face; gaze perception). These are abilities that are often difficult to self-assess and realization of strengths and weaknesses can often help individuals better cope with visual recognition deficits.
